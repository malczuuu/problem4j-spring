Designing clear and consistent error responses in a REST API is often harder than it looks. Without a shared standard,
each application ends up inventing its own ad-hoc format, which quickly leads to inconsistency and confusion.
[RFC 7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs][rfc7807] solves this by defining a simple, extensible JSON structure for
error messages.

**Problem4J** brings this specification into the Spring ecosystem, offering a practical way to model, throw, and handle
API errors using `Problem` objects. It helps you enforce a consistent error contract across your services, while staying
flexible enough for custom exceptions and business-specific details.

## Why bother with Problem4J

Even though Spring provides `ProblemDetail` and `ErrorResponseException` for [**RFC 7807**][rfc7807]-compliant error
responses, they have different approach than this library offers. It resolves around throwing `ErrorResponseException`
(or any exception that extends from it) or returning `ProblemDetail` in `@ExceptionHandler` methods for handlers of
individual exceptions. Spring Boot includes some default exception handlers in `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, but
that exceptions usually return exact `getMessage()` in `detail` field which may leak framework-internals to client
applications.

In contrast, **Problem4J** was created to:

- Provide a **fully immutable, fluent `Problem` model** with support for extensions.
- Support **declarative exception mapping** via `@ProblemMapping` or **programmatic one** via `ProblemException` (as a
  base class) and `ProblemResolver` (as a library-specific way to add `Exception`-to-`Problem` transformations).
- Interpolate exception fields and context metadata (e.g., `context.traceId`) if using declarative approach.
- Offer **consistent error responses** across WebMVC and WebFlux, including validation and framework exceptions.
- Allow **custom extensions** without boilerplate, making structured errors easier to trace and consume.
- Configure painlessly thanks to Spring Boot autoconfiguration.
- Provide a predefined set of `@RestControllerAdvice` implementations to override default Spring Boot responses, so
  framework details (such as full exception messages) are not leaked to client applications.
- Include support for built-in `ErrorResponseException` for compatibility.
- Integrate seamlessly with existing Spring Boot applications, by possibility to enable selected components only (via
  `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` or application properties).

Problem4J is designed for robust, traceable, and fully configurable REST API errors.

## Usage

Extensive usage manual explaining library features can be found on [repository wiki pages][repository-wiki-pages].

The primary ways to produce a `Problem` response are:

1. Throwing a `ProblemException` with a manually built `Problem`.
2. Annotating an exception class with `@ProblemMapping`.
3. Implementing a custom `ProblemResolver`.

### 1. Throwing a `ProblemException`

```java
throw new ProblemException(
    Problem.builder()
        .type("errors/invalid-request")
        .title("Invalid Request")
        .status(400)
        .detail("not a valid json")
        .build());
```

It would produce following response with `application/problem+json`.

```json
{
    "type": "errors/invalid-request",
    "title": "Invalid Request",
    "status": 400,
    "detail": "not a valid json"
}
```

### 2. Using `@ProblemMapping` on a custom exception

```java
@ProblemMapping(
    type = "errors/invalid-request",
    title = "Invalid Request",
    status = 400,
    detail = "{message}: {fieldName}",
    extensions = {"userId", "fieldName"})
public class ExampleException extends RuntimeException {

  private final String userId;
  private final String fieldName;

  public ExampleException(String userId, String fieldName) {
    super("bad input for user " + userId);
    this.userId = userId;
    this.fieldName = fieldName;
  }
}

```

It would produce following response with `application/problem+json`.

```json
{
    "type": "errors/invalid-request",
    "title": "Invalid Request",
    "status": 400,
    "detail": "bad input for user u-123: age",
    "userId": "u-123",
    "fieldName": "age"
}
```

### 3. Implementing a custom `ProblemResolver`

```java
@Component
public class ExampleExceptionResolver implements ProblemResolver {

  @Override
  public Class<? extends Exception> getExceptionClass() {
    return ExampleException.class;
  }

  @Override
  public ProblemBuilder resolveBuilder(
      ProblemContext context, Exception ex, HttpHeaders headers, HttpStatusCode status) {
    return Problem.builder()
        .type("errors/invalid-request")
        .title("Invalid Request")
        .status(400)
        .detail("bad input for user " + ((ExampleException) ex).getUserId())
        .extension("userId", ((ExampleException) ex).getUserId());
  }
}
```

It would produce following response with `application/problem+json`.

```json
{
    "type": "errors/invalid-request",
    "title": "Invalid Request",
    "status": 400,
    "detail": "bad input for user u-456",
    "userId": "u-456"
}
```

## Maven Dependency

Add library as dependency to Maven or Gradle. See the actual versions on [Maven Central][maven-central]. Add it along
with repository in your dependency manager. **Java 17** or higher is required to use this library.

It's assumed that Spring Boot will be already present in your project dependencies, as `problem4j-spring` is only an
extension to it and does not bring it transitively.

1. Maven:
   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <!-- pick the one for your project -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.github.problem4j</groupId>
           <artifactId>problem4j-spring-webflux</artifactId>
           <version>${version}</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.github.problem4j</groupId>
           <artifactId>problem4j-spring-webmvc</artifactId>
           <version>${version}</version>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```
2. Gradle (Kotlin DSL):
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       // pick the one for your project
       implementation("io.github.problem4j:problem4j-spring-webflux:${version}")
       implementation("io.github.problem4j:problem4j-spring-webmvc:${version}")
   }
   ```

## Repository

This repository maintains two major versions, supporting Spring Boot 3 and 4. The goal is to maintain both versions at
least until Spring Boot 3 reaches its end of life or becomes irrelevant.

## Building from source

<details>
<summary><b>Expand...</b></summary>

Gradle **9.x+** requires **Java 17+** to run, but higher Java versions can also be used. All modules of this project are
compiled using a **Java 17 toolchain**, so the produced artifacts are compatible with **Java 17**, regardless of the
Java version Gradle runs on.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

To execute tests use `test` task.

```bash
./gradlew test
```

To format the code according to the style defined in [`build.gradle.kts`](./build.gradle.kts) rules use `spotlessApply`
task. **Note** that **building will fail** if code is not properly formatted.

```bash
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

To publish the built artifacts to local Maven repository, run following command, replacing `XXXX` with the desired
version. By default, the version is derived from git commit hash.

```bash
./gradlew -Pversion=XXXX publishToMavenLocal
```
