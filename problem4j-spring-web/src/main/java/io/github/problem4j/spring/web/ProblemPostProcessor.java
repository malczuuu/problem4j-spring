 * Defines a contract for post-processing {@link Problem} instances before they are returned in an

 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Overriding standard fields such as {@code type} or {@code instance}
 *   <li>Injecting tracing or diagnostic information (e.g., a trace identifier)
 *   <li>Applying consistent formatting or metadata across all problems
